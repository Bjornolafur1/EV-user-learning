# EV-user-learning
This is a discrete event simulation of the charging behavior of electric vehicle, (EV), users.
The EV users live in approximity to one another, wether thats an appartment building or a suburban street and use the same charge station grid. Each user has a unique behavior, battery size and charge need. The amount of charge available will change depending on the time of day. Two different deep reinforcement-learning agents will be deployed to learn the behavior of the EV users and allocate charge to them with the goal of both minimizing the electricity usage during peak hours and prevent anyone from running out of charge on the road.
